# Gov 52 Replication Project

This repo contains the code and report for my final project for gov 52, where I seek
to reproduce the results of "Replication of "Economic Reasoning with a Racial Hue: Is 
the Immigration Consensus Purely Race Neutral?" by Newman and Malhotra. The pdf file 
contains the final report, and the .rmd file contains all of the r code to replicate my 
analysis and graphs.
